  "description": "- My motivation was to create a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. - I built this webpage to test my knowledge of object-oriented programming and to enhance my portfolio. - This page creates immediate access to the team's vital information. ## Installation I began by creating a repository on GitHub to push and pull my edits and commits to. I then worked in VS Code, using the content that was taught in class this last week. ## Usage     ```md     ![alt text](assets/images)     ``` ## Credits -- ## License --",
