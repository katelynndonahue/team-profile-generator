# team-profile-generator
## Description
My motivation was to create a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. I built this webpage to test my knowledge of object-oriented programming and to enhance my portfolio. This page creates immediate access to the team's vital information.

## Installation
I began by creating a repository on GitHub to push and pull my edits and commits to.
I then worked in VS Code, using the content that was taught in class this last week.

## Usage
    ```md
